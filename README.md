# The Searcher

An app that will provide a generic search portal and display results for any provided data object (JSON only to begin with).

The user will be able to load a JSON data set from anywhere and search it.

The v0.1 prototype will use hardcoded sample data.

Later versions will allow for any data to be imported and searched.
